Today I traveled from Boston to Berlin by way of Istanbul. It’s the first time I’ve been East of Western Europe. I wasn’t able to leave the airport, though, so Emily will tell you that it doesn’t count. I guess I’ll have to come back and explore for real sometime. My flight had a screen with photos and information on tons of world cities, and I couldn’t help but want to visit those places too, even on the eve of a new adventure.

I watched The Martian. I’d read the book a while back and really enjoyed it. The movie was pretty good too. I won’t make any comparisons to his isolation and my own.&nbsp;I don’t think I’d go to Mars. Low Earth orbit would be pretty cool though.&nbsp;

Travel days are strange folds of time. Like quicksand in an hourglass, parts of the day just disappear. The world in all its vastness shrinks to fit in my window and I sleepily cross from one side to another. However exhausting, I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of flying. It’s just too beautiful up there.

_Ka-thunk_ goes the stamper on my passport.

Hallo aus Berlin!
