I have a few days in Berlin visiting my friends Matt and Jess, and today I explored some of the city. I started off looking for a place to grab a coffee and pastry, but nothing caught my eye (despite plenty of options), and instead I spent most of the day just wandering about.

I went to see Brandenburger Tor, the famous gate that stands between Tiergarten park and Pariser Platz at the heart of Berlin. Later, I found an outdoor Turkish market with food, textiles, and various trinkets. I did some people watching in a park, checked my pass at Berlin Hauptbahnhoff, took the train a little ways, and bought a journal.

By the end I had made my way from Mitte, the historic center, through Kreuzberg and into Neukölln. I walked almost 20 miles in all, which is not too shabby. On the other hand, I did keep walking late into the day, it was quite flat, and I wasn’t carrying my backpack. But my feet feel fine, and more importantly, I don’t have any hot spots that would cause blisters. That’s good news for hiking.

Tomorrow’s mission: find a Berliner.&nbsp;
